# simple-collision-detection
### Project of Data Structure course
In this project, we want to implement a 2D collision detection algorithm step by step. In the 2D collision detection problem, some n-gons are given (which are not necessarily convex) and ask you the number of all collide pairs. Note that when 2 n-gons are tangent to each other this doesn't mean collision. Two n-gons have collision if their common area is greater than zero. This problem has many applications in computer games, physical simulations, and robotics. Many persons who are creating computer games use these kinds of algorithms directly or indirectly.
this project has 3 steps:
  - **Step 1:** In this step you will implement an algorithm to detect whether 2 n-gons have collision or not.
  - **Step 2:** In this step you will implement a _space_ _partitioning_ algorithm.
  - **Step 3:** In the final step you will use previous codes provided in steps 1 and 2 to have a complete collision detection algorithm. 

For more information about this problem see [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection).

***NOTE: step3 of this project doesn't exist on this repository***
