# Space Partitioning 

We intend to implement a _space_ _partioning_ algorithm. To introduce with _space_ _partitioning_ algorithms and data structures you use [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_partitioning) and [this link](cs.ucf.edu/~dcm/Teaching/COT4810-Spring2011/Presentations/JonLeonardSpacePartitioningDataStructures.pdf
). Also a list of data structures that can be used in _space_ _partitioning_ are provided in [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures).

Our code is a implementation of _quad_ _tree_.

## Problem Description

A list of rectangles are given. you must output all rectangles which have intersection with each other and use a _space_ _partitioning_ data structure in your algorithm. Also using multithreading is forbidden and your program must execute sequentialy. 

### Input and Output

In every line a rectangle is give in the format of $`(x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)`$
